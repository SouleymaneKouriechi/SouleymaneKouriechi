A description of your project:
Hello, Souleymane here,and my project is Sam(who is in this class) and he will be in a versace attire and will have golden-clad hockey stick and will  be hitting chickens to the goal post. Quite interesting isn't it?
What purpose does it serve (artistic, functional, exploratory, entertainment, etc.):
I would say purely entertainment but could also be a way for people to learn how to play hockey as I myself don't knowv much about it, so informational.
How will users interface with it?:
there wil be a set of controls and an instruction on the game of hockey and how everything words, so user friendly.
The language, libraries, and any other tools you will use.
I'll be using english and perhaps articles on hockey, no real life tools needed.
What will a successful project look like?:
A fully functional game of hockey that doesn't bug out randomly.
